#### Code Style Guidelines

**TypeScript & React**
```typescript
// Use functional components with TypeScript
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  isVisible?: boolean;
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, isVisible = true }) => {
  // Component logic here
};
```

**Styling**
```tsx
// Use Tailwind CSS classes
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-xl">
  {/* Content */}
</div>

// For complex animations, use Framer Motion
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
>
  {/* Animated content */}
</motion.div>
```

**File Organization**
- Components in `src/components/`
- Utilities in `src/utils/`
- Types in `src/types/`
- Context providers in `src/context/`

#### Animation Guidelines
- Maintain 60fps performance
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for smooth animations
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- Keep animation durations reasonable (0.2s - 0.8s)

#### Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers

## üß™ Testing

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component rendering and interactions
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for meaningful test coverage
